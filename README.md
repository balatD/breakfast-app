# Breakfast App :bread:
Breakfast app made to make organizing breakfast easier!

## Installation 
   
   To install the dependencies used by the app and to run a node.js server locally for testing.
   
   ```bash
   cd breakfast-app
   
   npm install
   
   npm start
   ```
   
## Building frontend   

   This will build and copy the Frontend Stuff to the necessary folder to be later used by the app.

   ```bash
   cd resources/templates/
   
   npm install
   
   npm build
   ```

Work in progress!
